# Cardiac-MRI-Orientation
The following are slice images corresponding to different orientations (from nii to png ).

CMR Image Orientation Adjust Tool. The graphical user interface (GUI) version is designed for the visualization and orientation standardization of individual CMR images. A complementary version of the GUI is the command-line tool version, which supports batch orientation standardization operations for CMR images and provides a simple parameter setting method. By specifying a folder, a single command is sufficient to recognize the orientation of all MRI files in the folder and correct the orientation errors.

The table presents the average accuracy of the datasets. The descriptions indicate whether the models were trained on this particular modality or transferred from other modalities. The high accuracy results provide the necessary foundation for the development of the CMR image orientation adjustment tool.
